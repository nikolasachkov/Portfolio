                    I am a Computer Science student with an interest in Web Development, Project Management, and overall getting an understanding of all aspects of an IT

                            mentorship of AATUES (Alumni Association TUES)! Distributed in teams of up to five members, students from TUES develope their own unique projects on
                            a for two days and present them in front of a jury on the third final one. The theme of the hackathon is announced in its beginning. The role of the
                            organisers is to make sure the event is well-planned and that it runs smoothly.

                            The same group of students that organise Hack TUES are also in charge of the organisation for the School's Open House called

                            Visitors have the opportunity to talk to both teachers and them in order to receive a whole understanding for the atmoshpere, school plan and
                            possibilities TUES offers.

                        <p>
                            As coordinator of the 2024 organising team, I was responsible for assigning tasks, helping with them when needed, organising meetings, motivating
                            the rest of the team, and solving conflicts. I also actively helped with the communication with our sponsors and partners. Upon entering the team I
                            had modest experience in the activities mentioned above, but I was eager to learn through the whole process of organizing, which happened thanks to
                            our mentors from AATUES (Alumni Association TUES) - Kirilka Angelova and Kalin Georgiev. Overall my participation in the team helped me improve my
                            communication, organisational, presentation skills, and teamwork.

                            Beware is a web platform, which puts its users in the shoes of a hacker, who managed to get inside someone's computer. Their goal is to complete a
                            series of tasks and collect data from the unlocked device.

                            Thinking from the perspective of an attacker teaches users about ways their personal information can get stolen and how to protect it, by following
                            security best practices.
